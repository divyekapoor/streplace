strreplace v.0.9.37
===================

streplace is the abbreviation for 'string replace' - and this is exactly what it does.

Did you ever want to replace a string in binary files everywhere is occurs? Did you ever want to rename thousands of files at once in a special way and/or make everything uppercase/lowercase at the same time? Did you ever want to modify the contents of symbolic links consistently because you moved directories? Did you ever want to rename your C++ class across all your projects with a single command? Then streplace is for you!

streplace can ...

  * replace regular expressions
  * reuse substrings of the regular expressions
  * replace simple strings
  * work on ASCII files
  * work on binary files
  * work on filenames (effectively renaming files and directories)
  * work on the contents of symbolic links
  * work recursively on directories
  * replace the slash in filenames as if it was a normal character
  * show what it would do without actually doing it
  * show how the modified files will look like without actually modifying them
  * be annoyingly slow sometimes
